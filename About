This project manages student records using Java and OOP concepts.
The Person class is abstract and acts as the base class.
The Student class extends Person and stores roll number, course and marks.
We use interface RecordActions so that StudentManager follows a fixed set of actions.
The StudentManager class keeps all records in an ArrayList.
It allows adding, viewing, searching, deleting and sorting students by marks.
Data is also saved permanently in a file called students.txt.
When the project loads or saves data, a Loader thread runs to show a loading effect.
Sorting is done using Java's Comparator (lambda function).
Iterator is used to delete records safely.
The project is divided into packages so code looks organized and easy to maintain.
The Main class only handles menu and user input, and the manager does all processing.
